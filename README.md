# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Goals of the Case Study
1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. Higher score = lead is hot (most likely to convert) and a lower score = lead is cold (not likely to convert)
2. There are certain problems presented by the company which need to be accounted for, the model must be built in a way to accomodate such changes.
